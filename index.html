            Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the
            black signboard that says "Prithvi Cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant 
            has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are 
            quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. It attracts quite a trendy crowd of 
            aspiring celebritites on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disspointments. On
            other days, the crowd there is pretty happy. hosts the famous "Prithvi Theater Fest", which you 
            must attend if possible.

        <p> I watched it today and I loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of
          the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. 
          The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a
          (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-Fi series. The movie shows 
          how the Avengers Assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. THe movie is lengthy, and it does 
          run for 3 hours all worthwhile.

        <p>The "Lion King" is ab impressive movie, with outstanding visuals and a story that is true to the original. The voice acting is good,
           with James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa. Despite criticism, the movie is true to animal nature and has funny moments for 
           children to enjoy. It is worth seeing for children, as the original film was a childhood favorite.</p>
